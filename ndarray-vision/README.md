This project is a computer vision library built on top of ndarray. This project
is a work in progress. Basic image encoding/decoding and processing are
currently implemented.

See the examples and tests for basic usage.

# Features

* Conversions between Grayscale, RGB, HSV and CIEXYZ
* Image convolutions and common kernels (box linear, gaussian, laplace)
* Median filtering
* Sobel operator
* Canny Edge Detection
* Histogram Equalisation
* Thresholding (basic, mean, Otsu)
* Encoding and decoding PPM (binary or plaintext)

# Performance 

Not a lot of work has been put towards performance yet but a rudimentary
benchmarking project exists [here](https://github.com/rust-cv/ndarray-vision-benchmarking)
for comparative benchmarks against other image processing libraries in rust.
